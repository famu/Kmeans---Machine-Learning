# Kmeans---Machine-Learning
Implementation of Kmeans Algorithm for clustering or categorization of data points. For simplycity data points are in the code contained in two dimensional array for x and y coordinates. So no input is required to test the algorithm. The resultes should be printed on the console window in a tabular form containing the results.
